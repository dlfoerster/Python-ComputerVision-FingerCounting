### Finger Counting Script in Python ###

The HandTrackingModule.py script was made by following the tutorial that can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZde8Xt78Iw&ab_channel=Murtaza%27sWorkshop-RoboticsandAI
It sets up a class HandLandmark to make selecting the correct handmark easier for the user.

The HandDectector class includes a few functions to make setting up a hand tracking script simple for use, such as the find_hands function and the find_position function.
